# mindloom

## Intro
Hello, this is a app called mindloom where i will make a app that will help us to log our notes, keep track of our daily list, areas we upgrade in within different category in a week in a gamified approach ( xp based ), log out journals, keep track of our feelings throughout.

`And if the time favours, a ai chatbot to talk with regarding all of it. `

## Tech Stack
For tech behind this app I will be using Next js, Django rest framework, tailwind css and I am not sure of what frontend frameworks will i introduce in the coming future.

I will also use `OpenAI` for the sake of whole AI part behind the application.
